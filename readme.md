# Daily Programming Challenges

## Preface
> I started this as a project to get refreshed with my technical skills, all the challenges are pulled from https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges . I will likely be using NodeJS & Typescript for a majority of my solutions.

## Repo Info
- Each subfolder of this repo will have a readme describing that challenge.
- Each folder will be named as is in the reddit threads along with difficulty.
- The goal is to use as few dependencies as possible.
